## Data Based System

+   There are 2 projects for this course.
    -   Project1: [MiniSQL](https://github.com/jiangshibiao/MiniSQL)
    -   Project2: [Simple-Library-Manage-System](https://github.com/jiangshibiao/Simple-Library-Manage-System)
+   My review is divided into 3 parts:
    -   [SQL与ER模型](SQL与ER模型.md)
    -   [范式和索引](范式和索引.md)
    -   [事务和XML](事务和XML.md)
+   We are allowed to take an A4 paper (written by ourselves) to the final exam. 
    +   This paper is still inside my textbook, so I will take a photo for it later and then update this folder...
